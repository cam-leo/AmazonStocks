In this project, I conducted an in-depth analysis of Amazon's stock data from 1997 to 2021 using Power BI, Tableau and Excel. The project involved several key steps and resulted in actionable insights regarding Amazon's stock performance.

# Project Overview
Data Import and Cleaning:

Imported a comprehensive dataset containing historical open and close prices of Amazon's stock from 1997 to 2021.
Utilized Excel to clean the dataset, removing any inconsistencies and ensuring data integrity for accurate analysis.
Visualization Creation:

Developed a series of visualizations in Power BI to uncover trends and patterns in Amazon's stock price changes over the years.
Visualizations included line charts, bar graphs, and other basic visuals to provide a clear view of the stock's performance trajectory.
Competitor Analysis:

Analyzed Amazon's performance against key competitors such as eBay and Walmart.
Created comparative visualizations to highlight similarities and differences in stock price movements, providing a contextual understanding of Amazon's market position.
Advanced Metrics and Insights:

Employed stacked chart visuals and other advanced techniques to identify North Star metrics such as Return on Investment (ROI) and moving averages.
These metrics were crucial in answering critical business questions, such as the key factors influencing Amazon's stock price movements.
Impact of Major Announcements:

Investigated the impact of major announcements, including Prime Day, on Amazon's stock price.
Analyzed the data to understand how such events influenced stock performance and market perception.

# Key Insights and Recommendations
Factors Influencing Stock Price:

Identified several key factors that significantly impact Amazon's stock price, including market trends, competitor actions, and major announcements.
Analyzed historical data to correlate these factors with stock price fluctuations.

## Business Recommendations:

Based on the analysis, we should continue promoting Prime Day, especially in the NA region. Prime Day has a notable increase in all metrics for Amazon. Future actions can include increasing the budget spent on advertising Prime Day, or increasing the length.
Other suggestions included timing of other major announcements, strategies to outperform competitors, and approaches to leverage key metrics for better decision-making.
