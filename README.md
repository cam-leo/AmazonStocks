# Project Overview

**Goal: To find certain North Star Metrics such as ROI, Moving Averages, Volatility of Stocks compared to baseline**

Data Import and Cleaning:

Imported a comprehensive dataset containing historical open and close prices of Amazon's stock from 1997 to 2021.
Utilized Excel to clean the dataset, removing any inconsistencies and ensuring data integrity for accurate analysis.
Visualization Creation:

Developed a series of visualizations in Power BI to uncover trends and patterns in Amazon's stock price changes over the years.
Visualizations included line charts, bar graphs, and other basic visuals to provide a clear view of the stock's performance trajectory.
Competitor Analysis:

Analyzed Amazon's performance against key competitors such as eBay and Walmart.

Note the similarities in spikes around 2020, which is when COVID began to take serious effect. All companies benefited from increased e-commerce, especially Amazon.

Advanced Metrics and Insights:

Employed stacked chart visuals and other advanced techniques to identify North Star metrics such as Return on Investment (ROI) and moving averages.
These metrics were crucial in answering critical business questions, such as the key factors influencing Amazon's stock price movements.
Impact of Major Announcements:

Investigated the impact of major announcements, including Prime Day, on Amazon's stock price.
Analyzed the data to understand how such events influenced stock performance and market perception.

# Key Insights and Recommendations
Factors Influencing Stock Price:

Identified several key factors that significantly impact Amazon's stock price, including COVID (~2020), Dot-com bubble (~2000) and the very first Prime Day (July 2015)

## Business Recommendations:

Based on the analysis, we should continue promoting Prime Day, especially in the NA region. Prime Day has a notable increase in all metrics for Amazon. Future actions can include increasing the budget spent on advertising Prime Day, or increasing the length.
Other suggestions included timing of other major announcements, strategies to outperform competitors, and approaches to leverage key metrics for better decision-making.
